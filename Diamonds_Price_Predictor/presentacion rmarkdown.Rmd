Predicting Diamond Price 
========================================================

This shiny app was built as part of Coursera´s Developing Data Products final project.

The app calculates the price of a diamond based on the following:

- Carat
- Clarity
- Cut

For this, ggplot2´s diamond data set will be used.

Linear Model for Price Prediction
========================================================


```{r, warning=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
data(diamonds)
head(diamonds, 3)
```


```{r, eval = FALSE}
lm(price ~ carat + clarity + cut, data = diamonds)
```

App picture
========================================================

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE}
getwd()
setwd("C:/Users/waws0/Documents/R/Curso/Data Products/Dimonds")

```

```{r, echo=FALSE, comment=FALSE, out.width=400, out.height=500, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
   knitr::include_graphics("app.jpg")
```


Conclusion
========================================================

As we can see, this shiny app is extremely convenient and easy to use for those that need to quickly determine the price of a diamond.

This is particularly useful for people that are not in the business but need to do a one off purchase and need to be certain that they are getting a good deal.
